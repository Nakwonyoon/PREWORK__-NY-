    <h2> Biography
    <p> Record-breaking South Korean boy band BTS (aka Bangtan Boys) balance an energetic blend of dance-pop and hip-hop with deeply introspective lyrics, which helped them build a devoted global following while also becoming the most successful K-pop act in U.S. chart history. Debuting in the early 2010s with their Skool trilogy, they steadily expanded their audience until breaking into the mainstream consciousness with the Love Yourself series. In 2018, their third official full-length, the platinum-certified Love Yourself: Tear, topped the Billboard 200, becoming the first K-pop to hit number one in the U.S. and the highest-charting album by an Asian act to date. They've since crowned the Billboard 200 again with the compilation Love Yourself: Answer (also 2018) and the 2020 release Map of the Soul: 7.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/bangtan.official/"> BTS official facebook</a> </p2>
